Evaluation Guideline:

1. There are 100 dialogues in '100_dialogues/' folder. For each conversation, please try to find the summaries that are unfaithful and incoherent (if there are any). Place the summary number in the corresponding bracket. 

2. For "Unfaithful?", please identify the unfaithful summary. Unfaithful summaries are defined as the ones that **contradict with the source conversations or are clearly wrong based on the source**. 
 
3. For "Incoherent?", please identify the incoherent summary. Incoherent summaries are the **ones that you cannot understand even with a reasonable level of inference**. For example, if a summary is unreadable, it is definitely incoherent. However, if it has some duplicate or unrelated words but you can still infer its meaning, we will tolerate this case and consider it as a coherent summary.

4. Note that when a summary contains something that is very general or unrelated to the source dialogue (e.g., "可以加关注,有泌尿外科男科问题再咨询", "你好!祝您早日康复", and "建议到医院检查一下"), **the general/unrelated information is faithful**. You can evaluate the faithfulness of the rest of the summary to make a final decision. Under the same logic, if a summary is only about general/unrelated information, then this summary is faithful.

5. "example1.txt" and "example2.txt" are 2 examples. Make sure you go through them and understand the evaluation.
