Annotation Guideline:

1. There are 100 dialogues in '100_dialogues/' folder. Please try to find the summaries that are unfaithful and incoherent (if there are any). Place the summary number in the corresponding bracket. 

2. For "Unfaithful?", please identify the unfaithful summary. Unfaithful summaries are defined as the ones that **contradict with the source conversations or are crealy wrong based on the source**. 
 
3. **Medical term asked in both question 2 and 3 refers to a disease name, a treatment method, a medicine name, and any biomedical vocabularies.** For example, "脑出血" and "聚维酮碘溶液" are medical terms. You do not need to treat words that are commonly used in daily life as medical terms. For example, "手术", "睡眠", "棉签", and "诊断" are NOT medical terms.

4. Question 2 asks to find all medical terms in the summary that do not appear in the source dialogue, while questions 3 asks to find all medical terms in the summary that also show up in the source dialogue. When you need to enter multiple medical terms in either question 2 or 3, please use "," (**English version comma**) to seperate each term. Leave it blank if you do not find any medical terms for either question 2 or 3.

5. As **an annotation trick**, it is recommended that you first read the summary. Then, identify all the medical terms in the summary and search ("control-F") each of them in the dialogue. By doing that, you should be able to answer question 2 and 3. Finally, after you become more familar with the summary and the dialogue, answer question 1. You don't have to enter text. Just search ("control-F"), copy-paste, and modify "t or f" to either "t" or "f".
